# Sophisticated-Learning

Code to run all four algorithms presented in the paper: ()
Each matlab script in 'Algorithms' is named according to the algorithm it implements.
To run one simulation of 120 iterations of any algorithm, run 'main.m' setting, run_SL, run_SI, run_BA or run_BAUCB to 1 to run Sophisticated Learning, Sophisticated Inference, Bayes-Adaptive RL and Bayes-adaptive RL + UCB respectively.
